# coding_website
This code is meant to run if 4 conditions are true:\
the html file is in a folder called html, the css file is in a folder called css,\
the video is in a folder called mp4 which is also in a folder called mp4, and the image is in a folder called image.\
These files are all in one folder.\
The css file and images could just have their links to the folder removed instead of making more folders.\
This is just how it was designed. As a folder for a website with organized folders for different file types.
