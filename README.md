# Coding_Website
# How to run the website:
This code is meant to run if 4 conditions are true:
1. the html file is in a folder called html
2. the css file is in a folder called css,
3. the video is in a folder called mp4 which is also in a folder called video
4. the image is in a folder called image.\
These folder are all in one shared folder.
# the alternative:
The css file and images could just have their links to the folder removed instead of making more folders.\
This is just how it was designed. As a folder for a website with organized folders for different file types.
